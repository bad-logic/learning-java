## Records

- Beginning with JDK 16, java supports a special class called a `record`.
- It is easy way to hold a group of values which otherwise would need to write a full fledged class with constructors, setters and getters.
- It is declared using context-sensitive keyword `record`.


```java

record Student(String name, String grade, int age, String department){
    // optional body statements
}

class Main{
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Student s1 = new Student("Ben","B",21,"Computer Science");
        System.out.println(s1);
        System.out.println(s1.age());
    }
    
}
```

- All fields are private final and only getters are provided.
- records are immutable.
- record can neither inherit another class nor be extended.
- All records implicitly inherit `java.lang.Record`.
- record can implement one or more interfaces.
- record can be generic.


### creating record constructors

```java

record Student(String name, String grade, int age, String department){
    // canonical constructor
    public Student(String name, String grade, int age, String department){
        this.name = name.trim();
        this.grade = grade.trim();
        this.age = age;
        this.department = department.trim();
    }

    // non canonical constructor
    public Student(String name, String grade, int age){
        this(name,grade,age,"Computer Science");
    }
}

record Student(String name, String grade, int age, String department){
    // compact record constructor
    public Student {
        name = name.trim();
        grade = grade.trim();
        department = department.trim();
    }
}
```
