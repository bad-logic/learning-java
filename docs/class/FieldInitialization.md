## Field Initialization

- when a class is constructed all the static and instance fields are initialized in the way they are specified or if initialization statement is not provided, they are given default initialization.
- It is not necessary to initialize instance and static fields, if not initialized default values will be given.
- But local variables should always be initialized or else compiler error is given.
- Local variables are never provided with default values.
