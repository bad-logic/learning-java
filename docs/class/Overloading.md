## Overloading

### Overloading Methods
> In Java, it is possible to define two or more methods within the same class that share the same name as long as their parameter declarations are different.
> if this is the case the methods are said to be overloaded and the process is referred to as method overloading.


> To say a method is overloaded, there must be at least two methods in a class having the same name but different signature.
> The signature of a method is the combination of the method's name along with the number and types of the parameters , and the order in which they occur.

- It is one of the way to support polymorphism in java.
