## 11. Automatic Type Promotion in Expressions

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ When a binary operation (like +, *, or any shift operator) is applied to values of type `byte` or `short`, the types are `promoted` to `int` before the computation is carried out.

</aside>

```java
byte a = 40;
byte b = 50;
byte c = 100;
byte d = a * b / c; // compiler error required byte provided int
int d = a * b / c;
```

The result of the intermediate term `a * b` easily exceeds the range of either of its byte operands. To handle this kind of problem, Java Automatically promotes each `byte` , `short` or `char` operand to `int` when evaluating an expression. This means that the subexpression `a * b` is performed using integers - not bytes.

But it can create confusing compile time errors. for Example:

```java
byte b = 50;
b = b * 2; // required byte provided int
```

In such cases where you understand the consequences, use explicit cast.

```java
byte b = 50;
b = (byte) (b * 2) // solution
```

Type Promotion Rules in Expressions:

- All `byte` , `short` and `char` values are promoted to `int`.
- if any of the operands is `long` , the whole expression is promoted to `long`.
- if any of the operands is `float` , the entire expression is promoted to `float`.
- if any of the operands is `double` , it is promoted to `double`.
