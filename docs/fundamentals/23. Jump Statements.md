## 23. Jump Statements

`break` , `continue` and `return`

`break`  :

- it is used to terminate a statement sequence in a switch statement.
- used to exit out of a loop.
- as a replacement for `goto`

```java
class BreakAsGoTo{
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		boolean t = true;
		
		first:{
			second:{
				third:{
					System.out.println("Before the break");
					if(t) break second; // break out of the second block
					System.out.println("third: This will not execute");
				}
				System.out.println("second: This will not execute");
			}
			System.out.println("first: This will execute");
		}	
		
	}

}
```

`continue` :

- if you want to continue the running the loop but want to skip the processing of remaining code in current iteration then `continue` can be used.
- like `goto` , `continue` can also be used with label to describe which enclosing loop to continue.

```java
class Continue{
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		outer: for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
			for(int j=0;j<5;j++){
				if(j>i){
					System.out.println();
					continue outer;
				}
				System.out.print(" *");
			}
		}
		System.out.println();
	}
}
```

`return` :

- immediately terminates the method in which it is executed.
- used to explicitly return from a method.
- transfers the program control back to the caller of the method.
