## 22. loops 

`while`

```java
while(condition){
    // statements
}
```

`do-while`

```java
do{
    // statements
}while(condition)
```

The only difference between the while and do-while loop is that do-while loop runs at least once even though the condition is not satisfied. `while` loop evaluates the condition and runs the body while `do-while` runs the body statements and evaluates condition.

`for-loop`

```java
for(initialization;condition;iteration){
    // body
}
```

`enhanced for-loop` or `for-each`

- available JDK 5 and onwards

syntax: `for(type value: collection)`

```java
public class Solution{

	public static void main(String[] args){
		int[] nums = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
		
		for(int x: nums){
			System.out.println(x);
		}
		
	}
	
}
```
