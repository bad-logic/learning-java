## 08. Float Inconsistency

Floating-point numbers in computers are represented in binary, and some decimal numbers cannot be precisely represented in binary. This can lead to small rounding errors when performing arithmetic operations.

Example:

```java
System.out.println(0.1 + 0.7); // 0.7999999999999999
System.out.println(0.9 - 0.1); // 0.8
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The key difference is not in the final result but in how the intermediate values are handled during computation. Depending on the specific numbers involved and their binary representations, you may encounter rounding errors in some cases and not in others, even if the final result is the same.

</aside>

To handle such situations, it's often recommended to use specialized classes like **`BigDecimal`** in Java for precise decimal arithmetic when dealing with currencies or situations where accuracy is critical.
