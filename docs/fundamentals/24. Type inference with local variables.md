## 24. Type inference with local variables 

Beginning with JDK 10, it is now possible to let the compiler infer the type of a local variable based on the type of its initializer, thus avoiding the need to explicitly specify the type.

To support `local variable type inference` , the context-sensitive keyword `var` was added.

To use it,  the local variable must be declared with `var` as the type name and it must include an initializer. E.x: `var avg = 10.0` . the type of `avg` is inferred as `double` .

```java
// valid uses of var
 var var = 1;
 var hello = 10.8;
 
 // invalid uses of var
 var counter; // wrong! initializer is required.
 var sentence = null; // cannot infer from variable initializer null
 
```

`var` can only be used for local variables. it cannot be used when declaring instance variables, static variables, parameters, or return types. Also the variable initializer cannot be null.
