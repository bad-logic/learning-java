## Introduction

Java is a widely used programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) 
in 1995. It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device or operating 
system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This characteristic is achieved through the concept of 
"write once, run anywhere" (WORA), making Java highly portable.

Java can be considered both a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code is first compiled into 
a binary byte-code. This byte-code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is usually a software-based 
interpreter. The use of compiled byte-code allows the interpreter (the virtual machine) to be small and efficient 
(and nearly as fast as the CPU running native, compiled code). In addition, this byte-code gives Java its 
portability: it will run on any JVM that is correctly implemented, regardless of computer hardware or software 
configuration.

Running a java program:

![java](../images/java_run%20.webp)

- create a file with extension .java ( Main.java )
- write  a program instructions.
- compile the program using java compiler  ( `javac`)

```bash
javac Main.java
```

- it will create a Byte Code (`.class`)  file ( `Main.class` )
- Execute it by running `java Main`
