## 15. Operators ( Boolean Logical Operators )

| Operator | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| & | Logical AND |
| | | Logical OR |
| ^ | Logical XOR |
| || | Short-circuit OR |
| && | Short-circuit AND |
| ! | Logical Unary NOT |
| &= | AND assignment |
| |= | OR assignment |
| ^= | XOR assignment |
| == | Equal to |
| ! = | Not Equal to |
| ?: | Ternary if-then-else |

Boolean logical operators shown above operate only on `boolean` operands.

Short-circuit logical operators will not evaluate the right hand operand if the outcome of the expression can be determined from the left operand alone.

`A && B; results in false when A is false no matter what B is` and `A || B results in true when A is true no matter what B is`.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ It is also very helpful when right hand operand depends on the value of left one.

```java
String x = null;
if(x!=null && x.length()>1){}; // doesnot compute right operand
if(x!=null & x.length()>1){}; // computes both operand and throws error
```
