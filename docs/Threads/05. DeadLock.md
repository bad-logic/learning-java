## DeadLock

- It is a special type of error that you need to avoid specifically during multitasking.
- Occurs when two threads have a circular dependency on a pair of synchronized objects.

Scenario: let's say you have two objects A and B and threads t1 and t2. 
if t1 enters monitor of object A and t2 enters monitor of object B. now if t1 tries to call any synchronized methods on 
B, t1 will be blocked since t2 has objects B monitor. However at this time if t2 also tries to call any synchronized method
on object A, t2 is also blocked since t1 has object A's monitor. Now both threads waits forever, this situation is called `Deadlock`.

let's see an example:

```java

@FunctionalInterface
interface ITask{
    public void perform();
}

class A {
    synchronized public void method1(B b){
        String thread = Thread.currentThread().getName();
        System.out.println( thread + " has access to class A method1");
        System.out.println(thread + " has lock on " + this);
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("class A method1 interrupted");
        }
        System.out.println(thread + " trying to access " + b );
        b.method2();
    }

    synchronized public void method2(){
        String thread = Thread.currentThread().getName();
        System.out.println(thread + " has access to class A method1");
        System.out.println(thread + " has lock on " + this);
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("class A method2 interrupted");
        }
    }
}

class B {
    synchronized public void method1(A a){
        String thread = Thread.currentThread().getName();
        System.out.println(thread + " has access to class B method1");
        System.out.println(thread + " has lock on " + this);
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("class B method1 interrupted");
        }
        System.out.println(thread + " trying to access " + a );
        a.method2();
    }

    synchronized public void method2(){
        String thread = Thread.currentThread().getName();
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " has access to class B method1");
        System.out.println(thread + " has lock on " + this);
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("class B method2 interrupted");
        }
    }
}

class CustomThread extends Thread{
    ITask task;

    CustomThread(String name, ITask task){
        super(name);
        this.task = task;
    }

    @Override
    public void run(){
        this.task.perform();
    }

}
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new A();
        B b = new B();

        CustomThread t1 = new CustomThread("t1", ()-> a.method1(b));
        CustomThread t2 = new CustomThread("t2", ()-> b.method1(a));

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        System.out.println("Press CTRL + C to stop");
    }
}

```

The above code shows the below output:

```shell
Press CTRL + C to stop
t2 has access to class B method1
t1 has access to class A method1
t1 has lock on A@29d3917
t2 has lock on B@6e3c329a
t1 trying to access B@6e3c329a
t2 trying to access A@29d3917
```
