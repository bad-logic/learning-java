## Executors

- Executor provides an alternative way of managing threads through the `Thread` class.
- The `ExecutorService` interface extends `Executor` by adding methods that help manage and control the execution of threads.
- `ScheduledExecutorService` interface is also defined which extends `ExecutorService` to support the scheduling of threads.
- Executors utility class provides the following static factory methods to obtain executors.
  - `static ExecutorService newCachedThreadPool()`
  - `static ExecutorService newFixedThreadPool(int numThreads)`
  - `static ScheduledExecutorService newScheduledThreadPool(int numThreads)`

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

class Task implements Runnable {
    CountDownLatch latch;
    String name;

    Task(CountDownLatch latch, String name){
        this.latch = latch;
        this.name = name;
    }

    /**
     * Runs this operation.
     */
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
            System.out.println(this.name + ": " + i);
            this.latch.countDown();
        }
    }
}

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountDownLatch cdl1 = new CountDownLatch(5);
        CountDownLatch cdl2 = new CountDownLatch(5);
        CountDownLatch cdl3 = new CountDownLatch(5);
        CountDownLatch cdl4 = new CountDownLatch(5);
        CountDownLatch cdl5 = new CountDownLatch(5);

        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        System.out.println("Starting...");

        executor.execute(new Task(cdl1, "A"));
        executor.execute(new Task(cdl2, "B"));

            cdl5.await();
        }catch (InterruptedException ex){
            System.out.println(ex.getCause());
        }

        executor.shutdown();
        System.out.println("Done");

    }
