## Synchronizer

- Synchronizers offer a high level ways of synchronizing the interactions between multiple threads.
- The synchronizer classes defined by `java.util.concurrent` are

| semaphore      | Implements the classic semaphore                                          |
| CountDownLatch | waits until a specified number of events have occurred                    |  
| CyclicBarrier  | Enables a group of threads to wait at a predefined execution point.       |  
| Exchanges      | Exchanges data between two threads                                        |   
| Phaser         | synchronizes threads that advance through multiple phases of an operation |
