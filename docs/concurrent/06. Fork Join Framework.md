## Fork/Join ( Parallel Programming )

- Fork/Join Framework simplifies the creation and use of multiple threads and automatically makes use of multiple processors available.
- The framework consists of following four classes

|                 |                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| `ForkJoinTask<V>` | An abstract class that defines a task |
| `ForkJoinPool` | Manages the execution of ForkJoinTasks |
| `RecursiveAction` | A subclass of `ForkJoinTask<V>` for tasks that do not return values |
| `RecursiveTask<V>` | A subclass of `ForkJoinTask<V>` for the tasks that return values |


### `ForkJoinTask<V>`

- It is an abstract class that defines a task that can be managed by a ForkJoinPool.
- The type parameter `V` defines the return type of the task.
- ForkJoinTasks are executed by threads managed by a thread pool of type ForkJoinPool.
- At its core are `fork()` and `join()` methods.
    ```java
    final ForkJoinTask<V> fork()
    final V join()
    ```
- The fork method submits the invoking task for asynchronous execution of the invoking task.
- The join method waits until the task on which it is called terminates.
- Another method `final V invoke()` is a combination of both fork and join operations into a single call. it begins a task and then waits for it to end.


### `RecursiveAction`

- It is a subclass of ForkJoinTask, it encapsulates a task that does not return a result.
- It is used to implement a recursive, divide-and-conquer strategy for tasks that don't return results.
- It has a `protected abstract void compute()` method that needs to be implemented by a subclass, unless that subclass is also abstract.


### `RecursiveTask<V>`

- It is also a subclass of ForkJoinTask. it encapsulates a task that returns a result of type `V`.
- Like RecursiveAction, it is also a abstract method. `protected abstract V compute()`.
- It is also used to implement a recursive, divide-and-conquer strategy for tasks that returns result.

### `ForkJoinPool`

- The execution fo ForkJoinTasks takes place within a ForkJoinPool. 
- In order to execute a `ForkJoinTask`, you must first have a `ForkJoinPool`.
- There are two ways to acquire a `ForkJoinPool`.
  - using `ForkJoinPool` constructor.
  - using common pool `static ForkJoinPool commonPool()`.
- ForkJoinPool manages the execution of its threads using an approach called `work-stealing`. each worker threads maintains a queue of tasks. If one worker thread's queue is empty, it will take a task from another worker thread.
- ForkJoinPool uses daemon threads. A daemon thread is automatically terminated when all user threads have terminated. Thus, no need to explicitly shutdown a ForkJoinPool.
- However, with common pool it is possible to call `shutdown()` but it has no effect on the common pool.
- Threads used by ForkJoinPool are daemon threads. so main thread needs to be alive until tasks are completed.


> `Fork` and `invoke()` will start a task using the common pool if the task is not already running within a ForkJoinPool.

#### `Recursive Action Example`
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool;
import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveAction;


class Transformer extends RecursiveAction {
  private int threshold = 1000;
  int[] data;
  int start,end;


  Transformer(int[] vals,int s, int e){
    this.data = vals;
    this.start = s;
    this.end = e;
  }

  /**
   * The main computation performed by this task.
   */
  @Override
  protected void compute() {
    if(end - start < this.threshold){
      for(int i = start;i<end;i++){
        data[i] = data[i] * 2;
      }
    }else{
      int middle = (start + end) / 2;
      invokeAll(new Transformer(data,start,middle), new Transformer(data,middle,end));
    }
  }
}


public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int[] arr = new int[100000];
    for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
      arr[i] = i;
    }

    System.out.println("A portion of the original sequence: ");
    for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
      System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
    }

    System.out.println();

    Transformer trnsfrm = new Transformer(arr,0,arr.length);
    new ForkJoinPool().invoke(trnsfrm); // create new pool to use
//        ForkJoinPool.commonPool().invoke(trnsfrm); // get reference to common pool and uses it
//        trnsfrm.invoke(); // uses common pool

    System.out.println("sequence of the transformed sequence: ");
    for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
      System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
  }
}
```

#### `RecursiveTask<V> Example`

```java
import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask;


class Summation extends RecursiveTask<Double> {
    private int threshold = 500;
    int[] data;
    int start,end;


    Summation(int[] vals,int s, int e){
        this.data = vals;
        this.start = s;
        this.end = e;
    }

    /**
     * The main computation performed by this task.
     */
    @Override
    protected Double compute() {
        double sum = 0;
        if(end - start < this.threshold){
            for(int i = start;i<end;i++){
                sum += data[i];
            }
        }else{
            int middle = (start + end) / 2;
            Summation taskA = new Summation(data,start,middle);
            Summation taskB = new Summation(data,middle,end);
            taskA.fork();
            taskB.fork();
            sum += taskA.join() + taskB.join();
        }
        return sum;
    }
}


public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int[] arr = new int[50000];
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            arr[i] = i%2==0 ? i : -i;
        }

        Summation sum = new Summation(arr,0,arr.length);

        long beginT = System.nanoTime();
        System.out.println("result: " + sum.invoke());
        long endT = System.nanoTime();

        System.out.println("Time taken: " + (endT - beginT) + "ns");

        System.out.println();
    }
}
```
