//Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k,
// return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0). The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the
// Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2). You may return the answer in any order.
// The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

//Example 1:
//Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
//Output: [[-2,2]]
//Explanation:
//The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
//The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
//Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
//We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
//
//Example 2:
//Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
//Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
//Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
