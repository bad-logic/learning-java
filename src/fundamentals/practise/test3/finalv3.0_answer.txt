Answer:

explanation: when test is called first test method throws an error which is caught by the generic
exception catch block inside the test method. and prints the exception message concatenated with
another string. and then finally block will be executed, after which the statement to print will be
executed, since we are neither returning nor throwing exception from the catch block. after the print
statement the control is returned to the main function. since no error are caught in the main function
the catch block will not be executed.

output:
Exception thrown in test method and caught by Exception!
In finally block!
In test method!
