// OVERRIDING EQUALS METHOD

//Suppose B is a subclass of A.

// If it is acceptable for B to use the same equals method as used in A,
// then the best strategy is the instanceof strategy

// If two different equals methods are required, two strategies are possible
// Use the same classes strategy, but declare subclass B to be final
// Use composition instead of inheritance – this will always work as long as the inheritance
//   relationship between B and A is not needed (e.g. for polymorphism)
